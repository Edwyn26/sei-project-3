The water garden is possibly the best spot for solitude, tucked away from the crowds, where the only noise youll hear are ducks flapping their wings in the spray',

No one speaks in a raised voice around here, and there are little signs with positive thoughts and affirmations. They also hold regular meditation classes and silent retreats.',

    description: 'This artist-led project has transformed a WWII bombsite into an impressive garden that provides free food for local communities. We often consider the plants they grow to be weeds, but they’ve been picked for their historic and modern-day use in phytotherapy. That’s the use of plant extracts as medicines or health-promoting agents, FYI. You can come down to the physic garden and pick some of 30-plus varieties of plants – with the supervision of staff – but they also have a deep investment in finding out how city living impacts mental health. The underlying ethos is that they provide a space that acts as an antidote to some of London’s stresses.',

While the British Library and the reading room at the Wellcome Trust remain firm, if obvious, favourites, a rising contender is Word on the Water, the 1920s Dutch barge that has been converted into a floating bookshop. Located on Granary Square (arguably a quiet spot unto itself as long as you stick to the canal away from the water fountains), it offers a polar opposite experience to the sprawl and stress around the station.',

Check off four of eight royal parks as you wander through *St James’s Park*, *Green Park*, *Hyde Park* and *Kensington Gardens*. If you’ve got restless little ones on your hands, stop at the *Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Playground*. Kids love the pirate ship, teepees and sculptures, all inspired by the magical adventures of Peter Pan. The route runs in a sweeping figure of eight, so join the walk anywhere along the way and end up back where you began – *Hyde Park Corner* is roughly at the midpoint making it a good starting point to pick up either side of the loop.

It was damaged again in the Blitz of 1941, but Wren’s creation remains standing and now nature is reclaiming the ruins granting it a beautiful half-forgotten, peaceful atmosphere, with climbers running up entire walls. Although it’s right near a Premier Inn, its location in the back streets means most people don’t know it’s there. At any time, it promises to be a pretty spot to stop and think. ',

Wedged in between the outskirts of East London and Sussex, Epping Forest was once a royal hunting ground. Nowadays you’re more likely to see families out for leisurely strolls, or dogs chasing squirrels through the bushes, but it’s a place brimming with natural beauty. Epping Forest is a one of the best quiet places in London to spend some hours walking, cycling, or relaxing in the sun. Taking a walk is a great way to clear your head, and with its numerous windy trails Epping Forest is the ideal place to take your mind of the stresses of city life and reconnect with the natural world that often seems like a foreign planet to London.',
