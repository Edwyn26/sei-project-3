# Project 3: CitySpace

## Project Brief
CitySpace, being my third project on GA's Software Engineering Immersive course, I worked and collaborated in a group with three other members. We decided on the idea as a practical and useful app in London, finding and posting sanctuary spots that people in the city can go to clear their head, a theme that we though would be beneficial in the pandemic - and beyond...

As part of the requirements we were set to develop a MERN stack application with an Express API from a Mongoose database, along with a React frontend consuming the API. The product was to be complete with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality with a visually impressive design. All built in a timeframe of 9 days.

## Process

Our initial step was to brainstorm ideas to what we could develop. After deciding on an idea that we thought of, we pinpointed key features to what our user would like and expect to see. Thereafter, a wireframe was made to visually pan out how our app would look and give further depth to creating the app.

After this initial phase, we discussed the tasks we needed to create the project. At this point we delved into assigning tasks on the trello board. A substantial part to tracking the progress of how we were managing our time and knowing who was doing what.
