# Project 3: CitySpace

## Project Brief
CitySpace, being my third project on GA's Software Engineering Immersive course, I worked and collaborated in a group with three other members. We decided on the idea as a practical and useful app in London, finding and posting sanctuary spots that people in the city can go to clear their head, a theme that we though would be beneficial in the pandemic - and beyond...

As part of the requirements we were set to develop a MERN stack application with an Express API from a Mongoose database, along with a React frontend consuming the API. The product was to be complete with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality with a visually impressive design. All built in a timeframe of 9 days.

## Process

Our initial step was to brainstorm ideas to what we could develop. After deciding on an idea that we thought of, we pinpointed key features to what our user would like and expect to see. Thereafter, a wireframe was made to visually pan out how our app would look and give further depth to creating the app.

After this initial phase, we discussed the tasks we needed to create the project. At this point we delved into assigning tasks on the trello board. A substantial part to tracking the progress of how we were managing our time and knowing who was doing what.

## Features

* The start would have a Landing Page, where the user can see the spots in London with a register and login button to use further features.
* Then a Sign up page for new users to input some details to access the places the user may like and a Login page for returning users.
* Then after the user signs in their name will be displayed on the index page otherwise a welcome sign will be shown. The index page will show a map of London with a list of the city spots along with a recommendation carousel to the logged in user to display based on their preferences tagged.
* Next, a more detailed view of each city space can be accessed through toggling over the map. Also, the user can see the space description with the tags the space has. The detailed view can allow the user to leave a comment, like or see the user profile who created the space.
* To add, the user can create a space and see their liked or created space on their profile page.
* An explore page is shown with the user to have the ability to filter accordingly or see all the spaces. A category with a name and number of likes of a space when hovering.

## Development

* In relation to the back end, I set up the connection for the app to connect between the back and front end. This was a crucial part of the project where additional features can be built on top of to deliver content for the user. 
* Beyond this, I set up the authentication, in the back end, for the user to establish a registration and login functionality between the two. 
* I also set up the display of a user when logged in to see a log out button, signalling that the user is logged in. Additionally for the front-end, I created the forms for when a user would like to create a space along with the ability to add, delete and edit their space if wished. I also worked with Elsie for the user to add and delete comments of a space if the user would like to. 
* I also created the feature for the user to upload a profile image and have a choice to choose another, if they would like to. 
* Additionally, along with Tobi we worked on creating the image carousel to display images of the spaces that would give a visibly professional experience.
* On to the styling portion, I worked on styling the welcome banner and showing the user's name to when they are logged in and displaying just welcome when they are not. Along with fixing some nav bar fixes.

## Wins
* The work as part of a group was an extremely enjoyable one, we collaborated well and helped each other when support was needed. It was a great experience to learn how others code and a great way to learn and ask each other why.
* The design was a great visual for the app, we worked together to really enhance on the 'look and feel' of a website that would look sleek and professional.
## Key Learnings
* Team Git: This part of the project of creating and merging branches was a challenge and a concept that I was not so familiar with. After the growth of the project and the practice through repitition of regularly committing work in this way, my confidence grew and found the process to be a natural part of commiting as a developer.
* The implementation of an API was a great way to understand how the data can be applied, something new from my second project of a 3rd party API.
* Authentication of the app and implementing comments were great building blocks to add to my knowledge of making a website feel more functional for the user.
* The dependancies in yarn were a great complement to using React and added to how enjoyable creating features are in developing a website such as the image slider.


## Future Features
* The expansion beyond London itself was a feature we thought to create but realistically given the time constraints we decided to stay with the capital.
* A practical and personal experience for the user would be to include a current location to potentially locate a space nearby.
