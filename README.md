# Project 3: CitySpace

## Project Brief
CitySpace, being my third project on GA's Software Engineering Immersive course, I worked and collaborated in a group with three other members. We decided on the idea as a practical and useful app in London, finding and posting sanctuary spots that people in the city can go to clear their head, a theme that we though would be beneficial in the pandemic - and beyond...

As part of the requirements we were set to develop a MERN stack application with an Express API from a Mongoose database, along with a React frontend consuming the API. The product was to be complete with multiple relationships and CRUD functionality with a visually impressive design. All built in a timeframe of 9 days.

## Process

Our initial step was to brainstorm ideas to what we could develop. After deciding on an idea that we thought of, we pinpointed key features to what our user would like and expect to see. Thereafter, a wireframe was made to visually pan out how our app would look and give further depth to creating the app.

After this initial phase, we discussed the tasks we needed to create the project. At this point we delved into assigning tasks on the trello board. A substantial part to tracking the progress of how we were managing our time and knowing who was doing what.

## Features

* The start would have a Landing Page, where the user can see the spots in London with a register and login button to use further features.
* Then a Sign up page for new users to input some details to access the places the user may like and a Login page for returning users.
* Then after the user signs in their name will be displayed on the index page otherwise a welcome sign will be shown. The index page will show a map of London with a list of the city spots along with a recommendation carousel to the logged in user to display based on their preferences tagged.
* Next, a more detailed view of each city space can be accessed through toggling over the map. Also, the user can see the space description with the tags the space has. The detailed view can allow the user to leave a comment, like or see the user profile who created the space.
* To add, the user can create a space and see their liked or created space on their profile page.
* An explore page is shown with the user to have the ability to filter accordingly or see all the spaces. A category with a name and number of likes of a space when hovering.
